<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Processing Currency</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>This is your processing currency and determines what currency your prices are displayed in and what currency you process in.<br /><br /><b>Important: This currency should be supported by ALL payment systems you have enabled.</b><br /><br />Check the payment system websites or view the docs to see which currencies are supported for each option.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Payment Mode</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Which mode do you want to enable? "Test" is for testing ONLY and will not take live payments from your bank. This should be the default until you are sure your store is working. <br /><br /><b>Important: For AlertPay you MUST enable test/live mode via your AlertPay account area</b>.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Log Responses</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Do you wish to log payment system responses? This can be useful for debugging problems. Log folder directory must be writeable.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Log Folder Name</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Enter name for log folder. Rename manually in store root.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Enable Free Pickup Shipping Option</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Do you want to enable free pickup/collection as a delivery option? There is no charge for this in the cart. This only appears if at least one shipping option exists. If no shipping options exist, free shipping is shown with no other options.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Allow Free Pickup Only For Buyers In</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Do you only wish to enable the pickup option if the buyer is in a certain country? Bearing in mind, a buyer may want to order from abroad and pickup when he/she returns home.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Default Shipping Country</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>If enabled, the default shipping country loads first when viewing shipping options for shopping basket.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Currency Symbol Position</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>For main processing currency. For example, for UK prices the &pound; symbol comes before the price. For Euros (&euro;) the symbol comes after.<br /><br />If no symbols are set, ISO code displays. ie: GBP, USD.<br /><br />Character symbols/entities are set in "control/currencies.php".</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Enable SSL</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Do you wish to enable SSL? Enable this ONLY if you have a SSL certificate installed on your server.<br /><br />This prevents return urls from displaying an insecure connection error to visitors.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Process Pending Payments as Completed</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Depending on the payment method used by the buyer, the payment status may be returned by the payment server as "Pending". This means that the payment has NOT yet been completed and the money is NOT in your account.<br /><br />If this happens, do you still want to process the sale as "Completed"? This is NOT recommended if you are selling downloadable items as the buyer could get the product and cancel their order.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Free Shipping Threshold</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Do you want to offer free shipping if the cart total hits a certain limit? This is the total before any tax or other discounts are applied. Set as 0.00 to disable.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Free Download Checkout Restriction</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>If you have free downloads in your system, do you want to force the purchase of paid products before someone can checkout with free products in their basket? For example, lets say Joe has
  added 5 free downloads to his basket. Should he also have x amount of paid products in his basket too before checkout? If no restrictions are set, Joe can check out and get his free products. This
  can be a useful marketing tool for you to offer free items, but only if someone has purchased something. An example might be the sale of DVDs with free poster offers.<br /><br />Enter number of products or set as 0 for no restrictions.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Force buyers to enter details on 0.00 (free) orders</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Do you wish to bypass the option for buyers to enter their name/email etc if the cart order is 0.00 (ie, free downloads)? If yes, buyers go straight to download page. No emails are sent to buyer and sale is logged as a guest.<br /><br />Note that as emails are NOT logged, the ability to re-activate a free download would
  only be possible by entering an email address for the buyer.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Enable Checkout System</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Do you wish to enable the checkout system? If yes, all checkout functions work as standard. If no, checkout link, basket and add to cart items are not available. Useful if you want to showcase your products, but not actually sell online.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Enable Insurance Option</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Do you wish to offer buyers an insurance option at checkout? Ideal if you are shipping fragile goods. Note that no tax is applied to the insurance charge.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Insurance Calculation Preference</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>If yes, how do you want to calculate the insurance charge? This can be a fixed amount or a percentage of the goods total, shipping cost or cart total. If specifying percentage, no percentage symbol required in box. ie: 9.99 or 20<br /><br />If required option is specified, this is automatically added to the total. If optional, buyer can choose to add insurance.<br /><br />
  <b>Fixed Amount (Optional)</b><br />- Fixed amount regardless of basket totals with option for visitor to remove insurance.<br /><br />
  <b>% of Cart Total (Optional)</b><br />- Percentage of basket/cart total, including any discounts with option for visitor to remove insurance.<br /><br />

</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Reduce Stock on Downloadable Items</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Do you want the system to reduce the stock on downloadable items? If no, stock is not reduced and the low stock notification will be ignored if set.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Global Percentage Discount</p>
</div>

<div class="blockWrapper">
  <p>Do you want to apply a global product discount? If specified, this would add a discount rate to every product excluding special offer products. Attributes are not affected. Discount is applied on checkout page.<br /><br />This is NOT used in conjunction with any other offers, so discount coupons are ignored during the offer period.</p>
</div>

<div class="fieldHeadWrapper">
  <p>Global Percentage Discount Expiry</p>
