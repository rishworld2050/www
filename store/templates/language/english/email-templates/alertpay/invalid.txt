Hello,

A transaction has occured from your store that should be investigated.

This e-mail is received when a transaction has come from the AlertPay website, but the merchant e-mail address and security code received do not match those specified in your settings.

For more information check the following log file:
{LOG_FILE}

or log into your AlertPay account for more information:
http://www.alertpay.com

If you are testing, it may be that your AlertPay settings or cart setup isn`t configured correctly. Check your setup. 

If you are in test mode, try a live payment to rule out the test server isn`t returning an invalid response.

Kind regards,
