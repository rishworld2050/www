Hello,

A transaction has occured from your store that should be investigated.

This means that the system could not create a valid match for the transaction based on the variables returned from 2Checkout.

For more information check the following log file:
{LOG_FILE}

or log into your 2Checkout account for more information:
http://www.2checkout.com

If you are testing, it may be that your 2Checkout settings or cart setup isn`t configured correctly. Check your setup. 

If you are in test mode, try a live payment to rule out the test server isn`t returning an invalid response.

Kind regards,
