Hello,

A transaction has occured from your store that should be investigated.

This may be due to a payment from an unverified account, in which case the buyer does not have a verified Paypal account and the system has rejected the payment.

For more information check the following log file:
{LOG_FILE}

or log into your Paypal account for more information:
http://www.paypal.com

If you are testing, it may be that your Paypal settings or cart setup isn`t configured correctly. Check your setup. 

If you are in test mode, try a live payment to rule out the test server isn`t returning an invalid response.

Kind regards,
