PLEASE READ                                           
-----------------------

The .php files in the 'admin/templates/language/english/' directory are admin languages files for the Maian Cart script. Edit them to suit your own preferences.
It is recommended you edit these files in a good text editor. Notepad is fine. Microsoft Word and other word processors are NOT recommended.

DO NOT edit the lang variable names in any way and be careful NOT to remove any of the apostrophe`s (') that contain the variable info. This will cause the script to malfunction. 
       
------------------------------------
USING APOSTROPHES IN VARIABLES
------------------------------------

If you need to use an apostrophe, escape it with a backslash. ie: d\'apostrophe. Also see the note in the 'templates/language/english/global.php' file with regards to javascript variables.
These variables are use in the store front end AND the admin area and therefore apply to both.

-----------------------
SYSTEM VARIABLES
-----------------------

Text between braces are system variables. ie: {count} etc

The system will not fail if you accidentally delete these, but some language may not display correctly.

-----------------------
E-MAIL TEMPLATES
-----------------------

The admin e-mail templates are located in the 'admin/templates/language/english/email-templates/' directory. Again, do NOT remove any system variables between braces. ie: {NAME}                                                                                         

-----------------
WHITESPACE
-----------------

When you edit any of the language files, make sure there is NO whitespace after the closing ?> tag. This will cause the language and the system to fail.

------------------

SEARCHING
----------------

If you can`t find a particular variable, use a good search utility to find the language you are looking for and search the 'admin/templates/language/english/' directory. 
Note that the same text may appear in several files.
