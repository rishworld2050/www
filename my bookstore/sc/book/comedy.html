         <h4>An idiot in Love</h4>
            <p>

Kieran McCall has never been lucky in love. This socially awkward, intellectually impaired Romeo has had his fair share of relationships, but none of them have ended well.

There was the time behind the bike-sheds, his first time, when he kissed little Kerry Newsome, promptly vomited on her and then received an arse-kicking in the cloakroom. The time he found himself embroiled in an animal murdering plot after trying to acquire his first girlfriend.

           <h4>Dog Food and Diamonds: A Romantic Comedy </h4>
<p>Two people from wildly different worlds whose shopping carts collide -- and eventually, against great odds, still find a way to fall in love . . .

If someone were to write a novel about the world of big box retailing, it could very well be a grab bag of horrors and tragedies, detailing the dismal pay and long hours that employees suffer in the name of low prices and just-good-enough merchandise all so the bigwigs and the bean counters can stuff their pockets with trumped up stock options.

It could be about that. Thankfully, this book isn't.

Instead, it's a lively romantic comedy that begins when Jeff Martin, son of the owner of the third biggest retailer in the United States, shows up at his father's Minnesota corporate office, newly minted business cards with the letters MBA after his name, ready to take the reins. There's just one problem. His father thinks his son is a frivolous playboy who'd run the company into the ground.

            <h4>Blind Dating: A Light-Hearted Romantic Comedy</h4>
<p>A light-hearted, funny romantic comedy - perfect for fans of Hilary Boyd, Christina Lauren, Lindsey Kelk, Deborah Cooke, Claire Cross, and Jill Mansell.

When mid-forties, divorced, single-mother-of-three, Kimberly, realizes her own mother has more of a life than she does, she decides to do something about it. Encouraged by success stories from people at work, she joins a dating chat room, ICQ, which starts to rock her world.

All of a sudden she’s a swinging single, online, with extreme dates, a little dirty talk, and a sense of her new, sexy self— until that fateful moment when her long-time chat-room buddy, LonelySingle, wants to meet.

"Are you trying to find a man on Facelook?" her Mom questions, after years of being told it is Facebook!
