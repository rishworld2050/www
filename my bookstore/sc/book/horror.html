            <p>The crash of a Dallas-bound jet wasn't just a tragedy to TV reporter Avery Daniels; it was an act of fate that handed her a golden opportunity to further her career. Mistaken for a glamorous, selfish woman named Carole Rutledge, the badly injured Avery would find that plastic surgery had given her Carole's face, the famous senatorial candidate Tate Rutledge for a husband, and a powerful Texas dynasty for in-laws.

            <h4>The Storyteller</h4>
<p>Some stories live forever . . .

Sage Singer is a baker. She works through the night, preparing the days breads and pastries, trying to escape a reality of loneliness, bad memories, and the shadow of her mothers death. When Josef Weber, an elderly man in Sages grief support group, begins stopping by the bakery, they strike up an unlikely friendship. Despite their differences, they see in each other the hidden scars that others cant, and they become companions.

Everything changes on the day that Josef confesses a long-buried and shameful secret—one that nobody else in town would ever suspect—and asks Sage for an extraordinary favor. 
In this searingly honest novel, Jodi Picoult gracefully explores the lengths we will go in order to protect our families and to keep the past from dictating the future.

            <h4>Vanished in the dunes</h4>
<p>
  Amos Posner has a lovely house in the upscale Hamptons beach community of eastern Long Island. But recent events in Amoss life are preventing him form enjoying it.  His employer, an international trading firm, fired him after making him the scapegoat for some shady business deals.  His wife, a highly successful Manhattan lawyer, has not taken kindly to his job situation, and their marriage is under considerable stress.  


     Amos is spending most of his time at the beach house, alone, and not at all happy.  So he is highly vulnerable when a beautiful woman approaches him on a bus – the Hampton Jitney – from Manhattan to the Hamptons and persuades him to show her around the area on her day off from her job as a psychiatric resident at a Manhattan hospital.  When Amos reluctantly agrees, he gets far more than an ego boost. He gets a nightmare beyond imagination.  And the cascading events could cost him more than the loss of his job and his wife. They could cost him his life.

            <h4>The Inferno</h4>
<p>In his international blockbusters The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons, and The Lost Symbol, Dan Brown masterfully fused history, art, codes, and symbols. In this riveting new thriller, Brown returns to his element and has crafted his highest-stakes novel to date.

In the heart of Italy, Harvard professor of symbology, Robert Langdon, is drawn into a harrowing world centered on one of history’s most enduring and mysterious literary masterpieces . . . Dante’s Inferno.

Against this backdrop, Langdon battles a chilling adversary and grapples with an ingenious riddle that pulls him into a landscape of classic art, secret passageways, and futuristic science. Drawing from Dante’s dark epic poem, Langdon races to find answers and decide whom to trust . . . before the world is irrevocably altered.
